# pantry_manager
Sometimes, we strugle keeping the pantry working and without waste any can or jar. The aim of this project is create somehow a system that help us to manage and update the pantry.

Some of the tasks are:
1. Get the product's codebar number from a picture and the expiry date.
2. Create a table with product's attributes of our regular groceries.
3. Create a DB with product's info and a possible action: add or remove from the pantry.
4. Create an expiration alert.
